# covid_visualizations
This code creates an animated gif file that shows the relationship between the public's mobility and reported deaths at the county level thirty days later. The values are 7-day rolling averages. The data includes all counties with 390,000 residents. This cutoff was chosen to include Orleans Parrish in the data.  

The sources include [Google's Mobility Data](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv), The [NYT's public repository of data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv), and the [COVID19](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19) API for R.
